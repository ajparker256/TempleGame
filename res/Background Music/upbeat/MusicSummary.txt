Tobu - Roots - A song that is upbeat and exciting. It is suited towards that triumph of defending successfully. Very solid for happy
atmosphere with montage moments (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wNb0pHyGuI).

City Lights - by the Lemming Shepherds (http://www.freemusicpublicdomain.com/royalty-free-symphony-music/), a song that could fit for a shop 
music over, but otherwise is probably too up tempo and whimsical.

Journey to Silius (http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/695678) - medium tempo background music good for general gameplay

Eternity (http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/695673) - Ambient Techno Peaceful. Solid for gameplay background music.

Aztec Temple Take One - Made by Daniel, its a splice of some non-copyright stuff he made, pretty solid background likely, mildly upbeat.
